# IT Spend Analysis

## Project Overview

This project provides an analysis of IT spending across various dimensions such as business areas, cost elements, departments, and regions. Leveraging Power BI for visualization, the analysis aims to offer insights into the allocation of IT resources, spending trends, and potential areas for cost optimization. By visualizing these trends, this dashboard supports data-driven decision-making for IT budgeting and strategic investments.

## Project Files

- **`IT Spend Analysis.pbix`**: Power BI file containing the complete analysis and visualizations for IT spend insights.
- **`IT Spend Analysis_data.xlsx`**: Excel file with raw data used in the analysis, organized into several sheets for specific data dimensions.

## Key Dashboard Insights

The dashboard offers various insights and visualizations, including:

1. **Plan vs. Actual Spending**: A high-level view of planned and actual IT spending, providing a quick overview of budget adherence.
2. **Spending by IT Area**: Comparison of actual vs. planned spending across functional areas such as BU Support, Infrastructure, and Governance.
3. **Regional Variance Analysis**: Visualization of spending variance percentages by region, with a map displaying global IT spend distribution.
4. **Spending by Period and Business Area**: A timeline analysis of IT expenditure across different business units (e.g., R&D, Services).
5. **Detailed Region and Period Breakdown**: Interactive views allowing selection by sales region and period, offering deeper insights into regional spending trends.

The included visuals help stakeholders monitor spending patterns, budget variations, and spending distribution across business areas and geographies.
